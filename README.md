# Adaptive brightness/auto-brightness for pc monitors built with Arduino

## Overview

This repository contains the Arduino code and circuit schematics to build a device that dynamically adjusts the brightness of a monitor based on the ambient luminosity in the room. The project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller and light sensors to create an intelligent and energy-efficient solution for managing display brightness.

## Features

- **Auto Brightness Control:** The device adjusts monitor brightness in real-time according to the surrounding light conditions.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimize power consumption by automatically dimming the monitor in low-light environments.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily configure sensitivity and brightness thresholds to suit your preferences.
- **Real time monitoring:** A window containing a graph of surrounding light intensity over time and a graph of monitor brightness over time is displayed.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Light sensors (e.g., ARCELI TSL2561)
- Monitor with adjustable brightness settings
